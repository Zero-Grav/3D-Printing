# Temperature-triggered cooling fans (one may define any number of sections with a "temperature_fan" prefix). A "temperature fan" is a
# fan that will be enabled whenever its associated sensor is above a set temperature. By default, a temperature_fan has a shutdown_speed
# equal to max_power.
#[temperature_fan my_temp_fan]
#pin:					; PWM output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided.
#max_power: 1.0 		; The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
						#  enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
						#  be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
						#  will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
						#  power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0		; The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010		; The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
						#  using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False	; Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
						#  enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
						#  constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#kick_start_time: 0.100 ; Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
						#  spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#off_below: 0.0			; The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
						#  requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
						#  effective. The default is 0.0.
						#
						# This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted. To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
						#  fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
						#  off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.

#sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F
#sensor_pin: analog13	; See the "heater" section for details about the sensor_type and sensor_pin parameters.
#min_temp: 0
#max_temp: 100			; The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the sensor must remain within. This controls a safety feature
						#  implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
						#  will go into a shutdown state. Set this range just wide enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error. These
						#  parameters must be provided.
#target_temp: 40.0		; A temperature (in Celsius) that will be the target temperature. The default is 40 degrees.
#max_speed: 1.0			; The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan will be set to when the sensor temperature exceeds the set value.
						#  The default is 1.0.
#min_speed: 0.3			; The minimum fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan will be set to for PID temperature fans. The default is 0.3.
#control: watermark		; Control algorithm (either watermark or pid). This parameter must be provided.
#pid_Kp: 40				; Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must be provided for PID temperature fans.
#pid_Ki: 0.2			; Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be provided for PID temperature fans.
#pid_Kd: 0.1			; Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must be provided for PID temperature fans.
#pid_deriv_time: 2.0	; A time value (in seconds) over which the derivative in the pid will be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The
						#  default is 2 seconds.
#pid_integral_max:		; The maximum "windup" the integral term may accumulate. The default is to use the same value as max_power.
#gcode_id:				; If set, the temperature will be reported in M105 queries using the given id. The default is to not report the temperature via M105.
