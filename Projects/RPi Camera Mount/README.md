# Raspberry Pi Camera Mount
Modified version of the Articulating Camera Mount from Thingiverse found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3114849

This has been modified to work with both a Raspberry Pi camera v1.3 or v2.1 and an Arducam CSI-HDMI Adapter.

* Raspberry Pi Camera v1.3: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RXKZ1KN
* Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ER2SKFS
* ArduCam CSI-HDMI Adapter: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDNBM63

Additionally support has been added for the Arducam IMX219 Auto Focus Camera Module.  There is a specific camera mount lid for it as it moves the lens 3mm lower on the PCB.

I will be adding support for the ArduCam 5MP Autofocus Camera.
Individual printers will require different numbers and types of the Link files
to be printed, based on mounting position and individual desire.

Currently the M6 profile ball nut does not work with the standard thumb screw.  The default ball nut
has issues mating with the default thumb screw.  An updated M6 standard profile thumb screw and
accomodating bolt will be submitted later for compatibility purposes.
