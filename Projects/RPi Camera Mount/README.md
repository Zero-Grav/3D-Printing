# Raspberry Pi Camera Mount
Modified version of the Articulating Camera Mount from Thingiverse found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3114849

This has been modified to work with a Raspberry Pi camera v1.3 and an Arducam CSI-HDMI Adapter.

* Raspberry Pi Camera v1.3: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RXKZ1KN
* Arducam CSI-HDMI Adapter: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDNBM63

The current design is known to work with the v1.3 camera.  A v2.1 camera has been ordered and will be
tested for compatibility. Individual printers will require different numbers and types of the Link files
to be printed, based on mounting position and individual desire.

Currently the M6 profile ball nut does not work with the standard thumb screw.  The default ball nut
has issues mating with the default thumb screw.  An updated M6 standard profile thumb screw and
accomodating bolt will be submitted later for compatibility purposes.

## STL File Legend
* [a] - Accent Color: can be printed in an accent color for a better looking finish.
* (o) - Original File: These files are unmodified from the original design.

Files located in [STLs/additional files/](https://github.com/ayerlock/3D-Printing/tree/master/Projects/RPi%20Camera%20Mount/STLs/additional%20files) were included in the original design but have not been modified or touched.
